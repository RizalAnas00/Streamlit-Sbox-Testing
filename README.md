# Streamlit-Sbox-Testing
Streamlit-Sbox-Testing is a Streamlit-based application for analyzing S-Boxes in cryptography. It provides tests for Non-Linearity (NL), Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC), Balanced Input-Output (BICNL), Balanced Input-SAC (BIC-SAC), Linear Approximation Probability (LAP), and Differential Approximation Probability (DAP).
